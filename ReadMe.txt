Description:

Calculates Forward Kinematics, Jacobian and SIngularity position for current frame coupled with Homogenous transformation matrices for both base frame and previous frame. All data are written and exported in a txt file. There are 2 preset robots, SCARA and FANUC. Plots by defualt teach plot, with extra plottings for current position and zero position with 360 animation. All angles should be in degrees.
